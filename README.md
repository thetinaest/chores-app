# Jessie's List
Jessieâ€™s List is an app that allows parents to teach their children the value of working hard and learning responsibility. 

Our application is a platform for parents to track chores that they assign to their children to complete. At a glance a parent will be able to see which chores still need to be completed by their child as well as add more chores to their list by using our user-focused design!

Don't worry about not being able to make it to the chore calendar to see if your child has marked off that their chore is done-- check our app from the comfort of your own device instead!
